                            <a href="http://rumahsabut.com/" target="_blank">Charcoal briquettes Indonesia</a> - We often see various products being processed, from coconut to food and beverages to beauty, health, craft products, and industrial raw materials. If it can be said that the coconut can be used in an ideal way, both for plants and fruits.<br> <br>

                            That's it, the tree can also be used as a building material, and the leaves can be crafted. Coconut water can be used as a source of refreshing and healthy drinks, and coconut pulp can be consumed and transformed into food and cooking oil.<br> <br>
                            
                            Coconut fiber can be transformed into various products, such as doormats and manufacturing train seats. Of course, coconut shells can be made with charcoal briquettes. Indonesian charcoal is a commodity and not a product of coconut processing briquettes.

                        <h2><span>The Benefits of <a href="https://rumahsabut.com/briquette-manufacturers/" target="_blank">Charcoal Briquettes Indonesia</a></span></h2>

                        <p>
                            According to studies, briquettes made from coconut shell charcoal have many advantages over briquettes made from charcoal or other fuels. See the description below.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Renewable energy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Renewable energy is the energy that we get and comes from original sources. Still, this raw material is the result of an established natural process, so it will never run out because it is always produced by nature.

                        <h3>Biomass Energy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Coconut charcoal briquettes fall under the category of biochemicals. Biomass is renewable energy that refers to biological materials obtained from living organisms. Some examples of biofuel sources include firewood, coconuts, garbage, and alcohol.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The maximum heat generated.</h3>

                        <p>
                            What makes coconut charcoal unique compared to other structures of charcoal? There are many elements to consider, including taste and cooking efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How much charcoal do you smoke for 12 hours?</h2>

                        <p>
                            Unlike charcoal briquettes, it is found that the heat produced by coconut shell charcoal briquettes is relatively high, above 7000 cal. Therefore, high-calorie fuels make our cooking process faster and more perfect.


                        </p>

                        <h3>Non-toxic Materials</h3>

                        <p>
                            Now, because the coconut shell charcoal briquette process is done by natural processes, these briquettes are safe for us. <br>
                            The only additional material is cassava flour obtained from cassava as an adhesive for the briquette dough. Thus, this makes coconut shell charcoal briquettes a safe and non-toxic material.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Smokeless</h3>

                        <p>
                            If you burn charcoal, usually, a lot of smoke comes out. For example, you can see that when you burn satay, a lot of smoke comes out, even if the satay smells good.<br>
                            But it's different from this coconut shell charcoal briquette. When burned, very little smoke is produced, almost smoky, so as not to disturb the atmosphere.<br>
                            
                        </p>

                        <h3>Switch to green energy</h3>

                        <p>
                            This is one of the best-known benefits of coconut shell charcoal briquettes. Go Green Energy is the term for a green energy source. <br>
                            As I said before, the advantages of coconut charcoal briquettes are made from raw coconut and cassava flour. If it is burned, it will not smoke, so these coconut shell charcoal briquettes are very eco-friendly.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Coal Substitute</h3>

                        <p>
                            If we see it frequently, charcoal is mainly used for industry. But from time to time, according to various studies, it turns out that burning coal on a large scale will be hazardous for nature.<br>
                            Additionally, charcoal, which is most likely listed as toxic, is inhaled by humans. This is why coconut shell charcoal briquettes can be an alternative fuel for coal.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Long burn time</h3>

                        <p>
                            Coconut charcoal briquettes have a long burning time, about 2-3 hours, without stopping. This makes for a pretty impressive and efficient fuel.
                        </p>

                        <h3>As an alternative to a gas stove</h3>

                        <p>
                            Almost all of us use gas stoves for cooking. Also, we are disappointed now that gas prices continue to rise and usage remains low at times. <br>

                            Therefore, along with the development of technology and times, various coconut shell charcoal briquette Indonesia have seen their potential in briquette oven making. The objective is to replace the gas stove that the house has used until now.
                        </p>
